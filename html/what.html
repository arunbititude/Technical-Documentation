                ReactJS is an open-source, component based front end library responsible only for the view layer
                of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.
                ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill in data (views) in HTML DOM. The virtual
                DOM works fast owning to the fact that it only changes individual DOM elements instead of
                reloading complete DOM every time
                A React application is made up of multiple components, each responsible for
                outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other
                components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A
                component may also maintain internal state - for example, a TabList component may
                store a variable corresponding to the currently open tab.
                <br>

                React allows us to write components using a domain-specific language called JSX. JSX allows us
                to write our components using HTML, whilst mixing in JavaScript events. React will internally
                convert this into a virtual DOM, and will ultimately output our HTML for us.
                React "reacts" to state changes in your components quickly and automatically to rerender the
                components in the HTML DOM by utilizing the virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is an in-memory
                representation of an actual DOM. By doing most of the processing inside the virtual DOM rather
                than directly in the browser's DOM, React can act quickly and only add, update, and remove
                components which have changed since the last render cycle occurred.
